## FIFO queue

Typical implementation of FIFO. Each node contains value field and pointer to the previous element. There are two types of operations available, both of O(1) complexity :

* **enqueue** - operation of adding new element at the end of queue.
* **dequeue** - operation of getting first element out of queue.
